    "# Predicting heart disease using machine learning \n",
    "\n",
    "This notbook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attemot to build a machine leaning model capable of predicting wheather or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.\n",

    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "> if we can reach 95 % accuracy at predicting wheather or not a patient has a heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll porsue the project \n",
